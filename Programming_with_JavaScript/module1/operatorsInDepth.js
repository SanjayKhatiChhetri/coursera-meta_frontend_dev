/* 
    modulas operator //mathematical operator, it is job is to tell us the remainder of a division operation.
    example: we have 24 candies and we want to distribute them among 5 children.
    we are going to divide 24 by 5 and let's assume we can't divide the candies ip into pices.
    but we want distribute the candies as evenly as possible.
    so we are goone be left with some candies that we can't distribute.
    and the modulas operator is going to tell us how many candies we are going to be left with. what is the remainder . 
 */

24 % 5; // 4
// 24 divided by 5 is 4 with a remainder of 4. so we are going to be left with 4 candies that we can't distribute.

/*
    Equality Operator which is two equal signs (==) right next to each other. 
    it is used to compare two values and see if they are equal.

    example:
    image we have two numbers, one of that is order refrence that we have saved inside the database with variable name oderRefNum .
    now image a user put there order refrence number into a form on our companys website and we want to check if the number they put into the form matches the one that we have saved in our database. 
    image they write the number 1234567 into the form and then for the sake of this example let's store that number in variable userInput = 1234567.
    now we want our code check whether the number that the user input.
*/

var userInput = 1234567;

//one example to equality operator.

var orderRefNum = 1234567;
var userInput = "1234567";

console.log(orderRefNum == userInput); // here the result is true because the equality operator is not strict. it does not care about the data type of the values that we are comparing. It olnly checks if the values are equal.

//type coercion: the process of converting one type of value to another type of value.
//underneat the hood, javascript is converting one of the data types to another data type. so, with same data type, the camparions can be made.

//strict equality operator: it is three equal signs (===) right next to each other.
//example:
// if we want to check data type and value, and tell us wether they are equal or not.

var orderRefNum = 1234567;

/* ::*****STRICTLY SPEAKING THEY ARE NOT EQUAL BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE SAME DATA TYPE.*****:: */

//inequality operator: it is two exclamation marks (!=) right next to each other.

/* EXAMPLE: 
    lets image that the user enter the weak password in our website and we want the user to change the password. while user is change the password we want to check if the new password is different from the old password.
